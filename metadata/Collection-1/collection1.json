  "description": "Indie musician and Pittsburgh native Stevie Flowers is a producer, songwriter, and artist that has broken out of 2021 swinging. His intimate and relatable lyrics create an atmosphere of honesty and introspection with inspirations from 80’s New Wave and Backpack rap bleeding into his production and lyrics. Bridging the gap between the sounds of vintage and modern, Flowers has a grass-roots following from indie fans and media outlets alike. Since 2021, the evolution of Flowers’ discography and connections in the industry lead to a collaboration with Tokn Music where he will be releasing his long-awaited single ‘In Circles’. \n\n Instagram: [@steviepicksflowers](https://www.instagram.com/steviepicksflowers/) \n\n Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/artist/7DmReHOrDivUmYnhNpuqQN?si=yOEWxeEYSMSsbO0QW6LcUA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7DmReHOrDivUmYnhNpuqQN?si=yOEWxeEYSMSsbO0QW6LcUA) \n\n Apple Music: [https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stevie-flowers/1547019128](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stevie-flowers/1547019128)",
